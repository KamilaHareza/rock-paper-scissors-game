## Overview
Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

-   Rock destroys scissors.
-   Scissors cut paper.
-   Paper covers rock.
-   If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
-   User can use secret move called 'bomb', then they win no matter what.

>My code will break the game into four parts:

1.  Get the user’s choice.
2.  Get the computer’s choice.
3.  Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
4.  Start the program and display the results.

## What I learned
During this project, I picked up if/else statements and switch statements as an alternative syntax that is easier to read. I got a greater understanding of arrow functions and helper functions, as well as JS build-in object like Math. I manage to finish it rather quickly and had fun creating it, for the most part, when adding an extra item for a user, to make this well-known game a little bit crisp.
